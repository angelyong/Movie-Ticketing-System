                <h2>Hey there! Thanks for choosing <strong>Absolute Cinema</strong>!</h2>
                <p>Before you book that ticket for your next cinematic adventure, please take a quick read through our terms and conditions. Don’t worry, we’ll keep it light!</p>

                <h3>1. Who We Are:</h3>
                <p>We’re <strong>Absolute Cinema</strong>, your one-stop spot for booking movie tickets. Whether you're into big blockbusters, indie flicks, or nostalgia trips, we’re here to get you to the cinema in no time. And yes, we also understand the importance of perfect popcorn.</p>

                <h3>2. Booking Tickets:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You’re booking a ticket for a movie, not a seat at a spa. Double-check your showtime and theater before confirming—no take-backsies!</li>
                    <li>All bookings are final. So, think before you click that <em>Confirm</em> button. If you make a mistake, we’ll try to help out, but no guarantees.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Payment:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you book, you pay. Simple as that. We accept various payment methods because we like to make your life easy (and your wallet happy).</li>
                    <li>Ticket price doesn’t include snacks. Those overpriced popcorns and sodas are on you, my friend.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Cancellations/Refunds:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can’t make the show? Life happens! Check our cancellation policy to see what options you have. But, if you miss the show, don’t expect a refund unless something went seriously wrong.</li>
                    <li>If the cinema or we need to cancel the movie, don’t worry—we’ll give you a full refund. We got your back.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Ticket Transfer:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Want to give your ticket to someone else? Go ahead, but remember, you’re responsible for their behavior during the movie. We can’t stop them from stealing your armrest or making strange noises.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Rules of the Theater:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it cool: no throwing popcorn (unless it’s in celebration), no talking during the movie, and definitely no spoiling the plot for others.</li>
                    <li>Just be a decent human. Everyone is there for the movie, not for the drama.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. User-Generated Content:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you leave a review or some feedback, we might feature it on our site (with your permission, of course). But please, be respectful. Everyone’s taste in movies is different, and no one deserves a 1-star review just because you didn’t like the plot twist.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Responsibility:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We try our best to give you a smooth booking experience, but if things go a little sideways (e.g. you can’t find your seat or the popcorn machine breaks), we can’t take responsibility for everything. But we’ll help as much as we can.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9. Changes to the Terms:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>These terms might change from time to time. Don’t worry—we’ll keep you posted. But check back here occasionally, just in case.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>10. Enjoy the Show!</h3>
